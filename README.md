# CODEJAM!

What is Codejam?

Codejam is a brand new event for Makers Academy that Stephen, Nicole, and Denise are going to organize on Friday. Codejam will combine katas, teamwork, competition, and most of all, FUN!!!

In each round, a small team of 3-4 (the coaches will build the teams) will solve a coding challenge. The judges will choose the piece of code they think best solves the problem, reflects good coding practices and explain why. There will be two rounds (hopefully!)

### Schedule:

12:00 - 12:45 : Sign-ups open. Link will be circulated over Hipchat.

1:00 - 2:00 PM : Convene in the lecture hall for CODEJAM!!

### Rules

1. You have 15 minutes to solve each kata. You will clone a repo to get the instructions.
2. You must work with your team. Everyone on the team must touch a keyboard at some point.
3. Final solutions must be pushed up to a Github repo when the timer rings! Hipchat your repo link to the Codejam room.
4. Every method MUST be tested. Ideally you will TDD!
5. You MAY use Stack Overflow, Google, documentation, etc.
6. You MAY NOT ask coaches, alums, or other groups for help!
7. It is OK if your solution is not complete. Clean code that is tested thoroughly is better than messy code, hacky code, and untested code.
8. If you finish early, spend time refactoring, ensuring good naming, and trying to catch corner cases!
9. I realize this is a lot of rules. The most important rule: HAVE FUN AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW!

### Learning Objectives

While there is a large element of gamification to Codejam, competition is NOT the end goal. There is no prize for winning.

Codejam is about:
* Working effectively in a small team
* Learning a few new Ruby methods
* Writing clean code
* Test-driving EVERYTHING
